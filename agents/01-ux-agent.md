# Prompt for UX/UI agent — Promptly V1

You are a product designer. Design Promptly V1 (a Grammarly-style prompt improver) as a professional, launch-ready interface.

## Context
Read:
- `docs/02-prd-v1.md`
- `docs/05-v1-outline.md`

## Goals
- Make the experience feel fast, confident, and non-technical.
- Turn suggestions into a “checklist that teaches”.
- The “Improved prompt” output should feel like the hero.

## Deliverables (text-only)
1) Information architecture + key screens (Landing, Editor, Results)
2) Layout wireframe descriptions (what goes where)
3) Component list (editor, suggestion card, severity badge, copy buttons, diff view)
4) Visual direction:
   - color palette (tokens)
   - typography scale
   - spacing/radius/shadows
5) Microcopy:
   - suggestion titles and explanations (examples)
   - empty states, loading, errors
6) Interaction details:
   - apply suggestion (how it updates the prompt)
   - “rewrite variants” (optional)
7) Accessibility checklist (keyboard, contrast, focus states)

## Constraints
- Keep it shippable: avoid designs that require complex custom graphics.
- Prefer a clean, modern, “developer-friendly but not intimidating” aesthetic.

## Questions to ask (if missing)
- Confirm V1 surface: web app or extension side panel.
- Confirm whether we show a numeric score or only a qualitative summary.
