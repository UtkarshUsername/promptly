# Promptly
Grammarly-style feedback for prompt engineering: analyze a prompt, explain what’s missing, and suggest improvements (with optional rewrites) to get better LLM outputs.

## Docs
- `docs/01-discovery.md` — questions + assumptions to validate
- `docs/02-prd-v1.md` — V1 spec (what we’re building first)
- `docs/03-architecture.md` — proposed technical approach (plain language)
- `docs/04-backlog.md` — prioritized backlog + milestones

## How we’ll build (per our agreement)
This repo is documentation-first: plans, specs, and agent prompts. We’ll generate implementation tasks and prompts for other coding agents rather than writing code here.
